		<h1>Species Specific Resources</h1>
		<p>The Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies CHAT includes habitat information for closely monitored species, such as the greater sage-grouse and the lesser-prairie chicken, 
		in the aggregated crucial habitat layer as each state deems appropriate.</p>
		<p>The modeled range of the lesser prairie chicken across five states was developed to help inform the <a href="https://kars.ku.edu/geodata/maps/sgpchat/" target="_blank">Southern Great Plains CHAT</a>. 
		More information on the lesser-prairie chicken is available at the link below. Range-wide information on the greater sage-grouse is also available below.</p>

		Lesser Prairie Chicken</p>
		<p>Over time, it is possible that western states may want to display species-specific data for additional species; if added, that information will be available here.</p>

		<h1>Crucial Habitat Data Resources from Regional Workgroups 2011-2013</h1>
		<p>In November 2011, the Wildlife Council created regional workgroups comprised of technical experts from their state wildlife agencies to compile the essential 
		data for the CHAT map layers (See Wildlife Council’s White Paper) for the Wildlife Council’s work plan and detailed information on the priority data inputs that 
		make up the CHAT). Workgroups evaluated region-wide data products and processes to assist states in defining and mapping crucial habitat data inputs. States 
		evaluated workgroup products and recommendations, and had the option to either (1) use workgroup products directly; (2) use workgroup products to augment 
		existing data; or (3) use state–specific information, as available. State–level datasets are not available for all priority data inputs, but those that are 
		available are typically more detailed and refined. Using common data products helped states to fill data gaps.</p>
        <p>This page summarizes progress and provides direction to access more detailed process recommendations and data products.</p>

				<div class="panel-heading">Habitat for Species of Concern</div>
				<div class="panel-body"><p>To provide common guidelines for species data processing, the Habitat for Species of Concern Workgroup 
				convened state technical expertise from 11 western states plus expert advice from Natural Heritage Programs in five western states; 
				University of Idaho GAP; and from NatureServe. The group produced a guidance document covering how to select Species of Concern and 
				create a data source table. The workgroup also reviewed spatial data sources for terrestrial and aquatic Species of Concern.</p>
				
				<p>States had the option to use species distribution models from U. Idaho/USGS GAP to complement states’ existing data on confirmed 
				species locations. For more information about the U. Idaho/USGS GAP program see the Gap Analysis Program Species Viewer.</p></div>

				<div class="panel-heading">Native and Unfragmented Habitat</div>
				<div class="panel-body"><p>The Western Governors’ Wildlife Council defined “native and unfragmented habitat” as areas that are contiguous, 
				possess a high degree of intact core areas or diversity of natural habitat, or supply ecological function to meet wildlife objectives. These 
				areas are unfragmented, or relatively unfragmented, by transportation routes, human habitation, industrial infrastructure, or other human-caused disturbances.</p>
				<p>The Landscape Integrity Workgroup convened technical expertise from ten western states and engaged with experts from Colorado State University; NatureServe, 
				the U.S. Forest Service, The Nature Conservancy and others to produce several innovative and useful west-wide products, and recommendations to guide crucial 
				habitat mapping. The Workgroup recommendations are described here. See the state metadata pages for specific information about the prioritization and data used 
				in each state’s crucial habitat map.</p>
				<p>The Landscape Integrity Workgroup used NatureServe’s Landscape Condition dataset as a starting point for additional analyses on Large Intact Blocks and 
				Important Connectivity Zones. A brief, technical description of these three data products is available here. Additional technical information about the 
				NatureServe Landscape Condition dataset is available here.</p>
				<p>The Landscape Integrity Workgroup produced three west-wide datasets and made them available for states to consider in crucial habitat mapping. These 
				datasets and additional technical description are available here:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Native Unfragmented Landscapes</b>: Large Intact Blocks that identify large areas of native habitat that are relatively intact or have low levels of 
					anthropogenic impact. Additional technical details are available here. To download the west-wide dataset, click here.</li>
					<li><b>Important Connectivity Zones</b>: Data layer representing buffered landscape pathways connected to core habitats of Large Intact Blocks. The Workgroup 
					created a west-wide data layer by ranking ICZs based on strength of centrality (or “flow lines”), landscape condition within the ICZ, and Euclidean 
					distance/length of each ICZ. Additional technical details are available here. To download the west-wide dataset, click here.</li>
					<li><b>Ecological Systems of Concern</b>: Dataset mapped by NatureServe including natural vegetation communities of conservation concern, and in some cases 
					clusters or patches of a natural community. To download the dataset and additional technical details, click here.</li>
