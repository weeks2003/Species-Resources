		<h1>Species Specific Resources</h1>
		<p>The Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies CHAT includes habitat information for closely monitored species, such as the greater sage-grouse and the lesser-prairie chicken, 
		in the aggregated crucial habitat layer as each state deems appropriate.</p>
		<p>The modeled range of the lesser prairie chicken across five states was developed to help inform the <a href="https://kars.ku.edu/geodata/maps/sgpchat/" target="_blank">Southern Great Plains CHAT</a>. 
		Additional information for both species, including range-wide information on the greater sage-grouse, is available below. </p>

				<div class="panel-body"><p>Greater Sage Grouse habitat is stretched across the terrain of 11 western states. Many of these states have developed 
				sage grouse specific maps to depict sage grouse habitat within their borders. Given that this species-specific information is available and has 
				been developed in great detail by a number of states, a direct link to those state's information is provided below.</p>
				</br>
				<h4>California</h4>
				<p>Eastern California <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Regions/6/Greater-Sage-Grouse-Conservation">supports habitat</a> for the Greater sage-grouse. Furthermore, 
				the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service determined that the Bi-State population of greater sage-grouse, occupying Mono and Inyo counties and surrounding counties in Nevada, is a Distinct 
				Population Segment. Greater sage-grouse are now candidates for listing under the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/es/endangered.php">Endangered Species Act</a>.</p>
				<p>CDFW is currently coordinating with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ndow.org/Nevada_Wildlife/Sage_Grouse/">Nevada Department of Wildlife</a>, the 
				<a target="_blank" href="https://www.blm.gov/ca/st/en/fo/bishop/biological_resources/index.html">Bureau of Land Management</a>, the 
				<a target="_blank" href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/animals/bird/cent/all.html">U.S. Forest Service</a>, 
				the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/site/ca/home/">National Resources Conservation Service</a>, the 
				<a target="_blank" href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/werc/">U.S. Geological Survey</a>, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as many public and private stakeholders, to 
				conserve greater sage grouse in the Bistate area. In June 2004, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ndow.org/Nevada_Wildlife/Sage_Grouse/">Sage-Grouse Conservation Plan for Nevada and 
				Eastern California</a> was released by the Bistate Planning Group. This plan identifies conservation strategies that provide an overall framework for sage grouse conservation 
				in the Bistate area. These strategies have been used to address sage grouse population and habitat threats and guide management actions at the local planning level. This sage grouse conservation plan is 
				an excellent example of working across multiple agencies to promote complex conservation efforts.</p>
				</br>
				<h4>Colorado</h4>
				<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://cpw.state.co.us/learn/Pages/GreaterSagegrousePriorityHabitat.aspx">Colorado Greater Sage-grouse Conservation Plan</a> was completed in 2008. The Colorado Department of Natural Resources (DNR) 
				assembled information (the "Colorado Package") about progress made in implementing the conservation strategies identified in the 2008 plan. 
				The Colorado Package was finalized in January 2013 in conjunction with relevant county, state, federal, and private entities.</p>
				<p>Colorado chose a "bottom up" approach of developing local conservation working groups and plans prior to the development of a statewide plan. 
				There are five local working groups in Colorado.</p>
				</br>
				<h4>Idaho</h4>
				<p>On March 9, 2012, Idaho Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter promulgated <a target="_blank" href="">Executive Order 2012-02</a> establishing a 15-member Sage-Grouse 
				Task Force. The Task Force submitted recommendations to the Governor on June 15, 2012 that were aimed at facilitating short and long-term solutions 
				to the primary and secondary threats to the species and its habitat in Idaho. Task Force recommendations were utilized to craft the State of Idaho's 
				Alternative for incorporation into the <a target="_blank" href="https://idfg.idaho.gov/conservation/sage-grouse/task-force">National Greater Sage-Grouse Land Use Planning Strategy for the BLM and USFS</a>.</p>
				</br>
				<h4>Montana</h4>
				<p>Montana Governor Steve Bullock established by Executive Order the <a target="_blank" href="http://fwp.mt.gov/fishAndWildlife/management/sageGrouse/habitatConservation/
				">Greater Sage-grouse Habitat Conservation Advisory Council</a> on February 2, 2013. The purpose of the Council is to "to gather information, furnish advice, and provide to the 
				Governor recommendations on policies and actions for a state-wide strategy to preclude the need to list the Greater Sage-grouse under the ESA, by no later than January 31, 2014. 
				Council members include representatives from agriculture and ranching, conservation and sportsmen, energy, mining and power transmission, tribal government, local government, 
				and the legislature.</p>
				</br>
				<h4>Nevada</h4>
				<p>Nevada's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ndow.org/Nevada_Wildlife/Sage_Grouse/">Greater Sage-grouse Habitat Categorization Map</a> is an analysis tool that incorporates the 
				best available data (lek observations, telemetry locations, survey and inventory reports, vegetation cover, soils information, and aerial photography) into a statewide prioritization 
				of Greater sage-grouse (sage-grouse) habitat. This tool provides resource managers with information to guide conservation and land-use planning 
				efforts in the context of sage-grouse management at the landscape-scale.</p>
				</br>
				<h4>Oregon</h4>
				<p>Oregon adopted the state's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dfw.state.or.us/wildlife/sagegrouse/docs/20110422_GRSG_April_Final%2052511.pdf">Greater Sage-Grouse Conservation 
				and Assessment and Strategy</a> in 2011. The plan was developed with the oversight of a statewide interdisciplinary team with representatives from federal and state agencies 
				and private landowners. The Plan is intended to promote the conservation of greater sage-grouse and intact functioning sagebrush communities in Oregon. Although the plan focuses 
				on the conservation of sage-grouse, the intent is to benefit conservation needs of other sagebrush-steppe species. Five local implementation 
				groups work to put the plan into service on the ground.</p>
				<p>The plan uses a core area approach to implement sage-grouse conservation. About 36% of the extant range of sage-grouse in Oregon was 
				identified as <a target="_blank" href="https://nrimp.dfw.state.or.us/web%20stores/data%20libraries/files/ODFW/ODFW_944_4_Map_ODFW_SagegrouseCoreAreas_20110724.pdf">core area</a> and 
				includes about 90% of the known breeding population. An additional 29% was identified as 'low density area' habitat and includes most of the remaining sage-grouse breeding population. 
				The goal of establishing core areas is to address greater sage-grouse management from a conservation biology perspective that identifies the most productive populations 
				and habitat that meets all life history needs.</p>
				<p>Over the last two years, the Governor's Office and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) have been convening meetings in response to the 
				"Warranted but Precluded" sage-grouse listing status in order to share information about the needs and issues related to renewable energy development 
				and habitat conservation across Eastern Oregon. These meetings led to the formation of the Sage-Grouse Conservation Partnership 
				(<a target="_blank" href="http://orsolutions.org/osproject/sagecon">SageCon</a>).</p>
				<p>The SageCon Partnership coordinates federal, state and local efforts (current and projected) to address the multiple threats to sage grouse 
				across the Eastern Oregon sagebrush landscape in anticipation of the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) review of the bird's "Warranted But Precluded" 
				status under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) (listing decision and critical habitat proposal due in September 2014). SageCon focuses on working 
				together to pull together an "all lands, all threats" approach to sage-grouse conservation to both address USFWS's sage grouse listing decision in 2015 
				and support community sustainability in central and eastern Oregon into the future. By addressing identified threats to sage brush habitat, the SageCon 
				Partnership will ensure species protection for sage-grouse, while also working with traditional ranching and farming communities, as well as emerging 
				industries such as mining and renewable energy.</p>
				<p><a target="_blank" href="https://nrimp.dfw.state.or.us/DataClearinghouse/default.aspx?p=202&XMLname=944.xml">Data and maps from the ODFW Greater Sage-Grouse 
				Conservation and Assessment and Strategy are available through the ODFW Data Clearinghouse</a>. A detailed description of how the ODFW Sage-Grouse Core Areas are included 
				in the Oregon Crucial Habitat Analysis is available through the Oregon State Metadata, within the Terrestrial Species of Concern Data Input Layer.</p>
				</br>
				<h4>South Dakota</h4>
				<p>The goal for sage grouse management in South Dakota is to monitor and maintain a sage grouse population and habitats consistent with the 
				ecological, social, and aesthetics values of South Dakota citizens while addressing the concerns and issues of both residents and visitors of 
				South Dakota.</p>
				</br>
				<h4>Utah</h4>
				<p><a target="_blank" href="https://wildlife.utah.gov/learn-more/greater-sage-grouse.html">Utah's Conservation Plan for Greater Sage-grouse</a> is designed to eliminate threats 
				facing the Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) while balancing economic and social needs of the residents of Utah.</p>
				<p>This Plan is anchored around efforts to conserve the species within eleven specifically identified Sage-grouse Management Areas (SGMAs). 
				These SGMAs encompass the highest sage-grouse breeding density areas, which together currently support greater than 94% of the Utah aggregate population 
				of greater sage-grouse. The SGMAs represent the best opportunity for high-value, focused conservation efforts for the species in Utah. Sage-grouse habitat 
				outside the SGMAs is not required for long-term conservation of the species, therefore, no specific management actions for this habitat are recommended or 
				required in the Plan. Private lands, county or municipally owned lands, and SITLA lands will require the acquisition of voluntarily negotiated 
				incentive-based covenants, easements, leases, or other legal tools to achieve conservation purposes within Sage-grouse Management Areas. 
				The plan is available <a target="_blank" href="https://wildlife.utah.gov/uplandgame/sage-grouse/pdf/greater_sage_grouse_plan.pdf">here</a>.</p>
				</br>
				<h4>Washington</h4>
				<p>Washington has enacted conservation measures for the sage-grouse as identified in the <a target="_blank" href="https://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/00395/">Washington State Recovery 
				Plan for the Greater Sage-Grouse</a>. Washington has also <a target="_blank" href="https://wdfw.wa.gov/conservation/research/projects/grouse/reintroduction_lincoln_co/">re-introduced</a> 
				sage-grouse into certain regions of the state.</p>
				</br>
				<h4>Wyoming</h4>
				<p>Wyoming continues to implement its Sage-Grouse Executive Order (SGEO) through the regulatory authority of its state agencies, and collaboration 
				with industry, federal land management agencies, and local sage-grouse working groups. The Sage-Grouse Implementation Team continues to provide an 
				effective forum for coordination of sage-grouse conservation efforts among all stakeholders, statewide.</p>
				<p>The Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD) coordinated the development of the <a target="_blank" href="http://ddct.wygisc.org/">Density Disturbance Calculation Tool (DDCT)</a> and an online application 
				for the DDCT process. The DDCT is a primary project evaluation tool for applying the SGEO's disturbance stipulations to projects within sage-grouse core 
				areas. All Density Disturbance Calculations are reviewed by the WGFD for compliance with the SGEO for state and federal agencies.

				<div id="lpc" class="panel-collapse collapse">
				<div class="panel-body"><p>The lesser prairie-chicken (LEPC) is a species of prairie grouse that inhabits grasslands/shrublands within a range 
				covering five states in the Southern Great Plains (Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas). The Western Association of Fish and Wildlife 
				Agencies CHAT includes two data layers specific to the LEPC -- the Estimated Occupied Range (EOR) for the species and the Focal Areas/Connectivity 
				Zones (FACZ) where LEPC habitat conservation actions will be emphasized to expand and sustain the species.</p>
				<p>In 1995, the USFWS determined the LEPC to be “warranted but precluded” for listing under the Endangered Species Act. States with LEPC habitat 
				have since led the way in conservation actions to preclude the need to list the species. One of the primary mechanisms for the states' collaboration 
				has been through the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies' (WAFWA) LEPC Interstate Working Group (IWG). The IWG has created a 
				Range-Wide Plan which identifies management practices to conserve the species and its habitat, and includes the LEPC data layers shown here in the 
				CHAT.</p>
				<p>The Southern Great Plains CHAT (SGP CHAT) is, in many ways, the spatial representation of the Range-Wide Plan. The EOR and FACZ data layers 
				are included in the management recommendations of the Range-Wide Plan as a means to identify core population areas and the corridors that link 
				these areas. This information is meant to encourage development into areas where impacts to LEPC will be minimal or completely avoided, and to 
				steer conservation programs to concentrate benefits in the most important areas for the species.</p>
				<p>For more information, explore the Southern Great Plains CHAT (SGP CHAT) for additional information concerning the LEPC across its five-state 
				range. Users can also access the latest LEPC news and the Range-Wide Plan for conserving the lesser prairie-chicken from the WAFWA LEPC

		<h1>Crucial Habitat Data Resources from Regional Workgroups 2011-2013</h1>
		<p>In November 2011, the Wildlife Council created regional workgroups comprised of technical experts from their state wildlife agencies to compile the essential 
		data for the CHAT map layers (See Wildlife Council’s White Paper) for the Wildlife Council’s work plan and detailed information on the priority data inputs that 
		make up the CHAT). Workgroups evaluated region-wide data products and processes to assist states in defining and mapping crucial habitat data inputs. States 
		evaluated workgroup products and recommendations, and had the option to either (1) use workgroup products directly; (2) use workgroup products to augment 
		existing data; or (3) use state–specific information, as available. State–level datasets are not available for all priority data inputs, but those that are 
		available are typically more detailed and refined. Using common data products helped states to fill data gaps.</p>
        <p>This page summarizes progress and provides direction to access more detailed process recommendations and data products.</p>

				possess a high degree of intact core areas or diversity of natural habitat, or supply ecological function to meet wildlife objectives. These 
				areas are unfragmented, or relatively unfragmented, by transportation routes, human habitation, industrial infrastructure, or other human-caused disturbances.</p>
				<p>The Landscape Integrity Workgroup convened technical expertise from ten western states and engaged with experts from Colorado State University; NatureServe, 
				the U.S. Forest Service, The Nature Conservancy and others to produce several innovative and useful west-wide products, and recommendations to guide crucial

				and function to support animal and plant diversity with respect to wildlife objectives and connectivity.</p>
				<p>The Species of Concern Workgroup identified the National Fish Habitat Action Plan’s (NFHAP) Assessment of Freshwater Integrity as a “wall to wall” 
				national product to complement the Aquatic Species of Concern dataset. The NFHAP assessment reflects habitat quality for aquatic species using a

				six priority levels.</p>
				<p>The prioritization and ranking of aquatic crucial habitat, and riparian and wetland habitats differs across the vast geography of the West

				<p>The Species of Economic and Recreational Importance Workgroup (SERI) convened technical expertise from seven western states and 
				recommended that states consider important game species to include in crucial habitat maps, especially if not already mapped under 
				"Habitat for Species of Concern" above. The SERI workgroup recommended that states assess their data holdings covering their priority 
				game species, use state data sources wherever possible, and incorporate mapped information on big game, upland game, waterfowl, and 
				furbearer species, where available.</p>
				<p>The workgroup recommended that individual game species habitat maps be categorized into "priority habitat" and "general habitat" to 
				designate areas of increased importance where needed for a particular species. The workgroup then recommended a ranking system of habitat 
				in this order (highest to lowest):</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Areas with multiple game species’ priority habitat.</li>
					<li>Areas with fewer game species’ priority habitat.</li>
					<li>Areas with only one game species’ priority habitat or areas with multiple game species’ general habitat.</li>

				<p>The SERI workgroup evaluated region-wide datasets that could be used exclusively or in combination with state data as needed. 
				The SERI workgroup also produced GIS tools for state technical staff to use in assigning big game distribution maps to hexagons
