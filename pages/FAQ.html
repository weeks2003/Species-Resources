						<p>"CHAT" stands for Crucial Habitat Assessment Tool. CHAT is an online system of maps that displays crucial wildlife habitat 
						based on commonly agreed upon definitions developed by the Western Governor's Wildlife Council. The Western Assocaition of 
						Fish and Wildlife Agencies CHAT provides information across 16 western states, but also links to five state-level CHATs 
						and new state CHATs as they become available.</p>

				<div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" href="#q2">What is the origin of the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies CHAT?</div>
				<div id="q2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>To help ensure both wildlife and local economies remain viable, Western Governors asked the Western Governors' Association in 2007 to 
						examine how state wildlife agencies could be more collaborative and innovative as they provide wildlife species and habitat information 
						to their various "customers," including federal agencies, state agencies, local and tribal governments, conservation advocates, industry, 
						and private landowners. As a result, Western Governors established the Western Governors' Wildlife Council, named their representatives 
						to it, and asked it to identify key wildlife corridors and crucial wildlife habitats in the West and to make that information publicly 
						available.</p>

				<div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" href="#q3">What is the purpose of the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies CHAT?</div>
				<div id="q3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>The Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies CHAT provides a high-level, coarse-scale overview of crucial habitat for pre-planning 
						on a wide variety of projects across the West. At this coarse scale, CHAT provides a "first-look" at crucial wildlife habitat at the "30,000-foot 
						level."</p>
						<p>The CHAT connects users with state-level CHATs, which provide more detailed and state-specific maps and information. No online planning tool, 
						however, is a substitute for on-the-ground surveys or consultation with state wildlife experts. Both the regional and state-level CHATs aim to 
						increase the efficiency and predictability of formal planning efforts by establishing a common starting point to discuss the intersection of 
						development and wildlife.</p>

				<div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" href="#q4">What do you mean by "common starting point"?</div>
				<div id="q4" class="panel-collapse collapse">
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>The Western Governors' Wildlife Council has established common definitions of crucial habitat and corridors for wildlife and issued guidelines 
						to help each state prioritize habitat within its boundaries to meet its specific conservation objectives. The definitions and guidance are set 
						forth in the Council's White Paper. The region-wide definitions also help to achieve compatibility and consistency across state boundaries and 
						address certain discrepancies that may exist in identifying habitat and natural features along state borders.</p>

				<div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" href="#q5">Is CHAT a regulatory tool?</div>
				<div id="q5" class="panel-collapse collapse">
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>No. The state and regional CHATs are non-regulatory and cannot be used for project-level reviews. CHAT simply gives project planners and the 
						public access to state wildlife agency scientific data on a broad scale for use in initial project assessment, siting and pre-planning – including 
						for large-scale development projects spanning multiple jurisdictions. This information will help to avoid conflicts and surprises while ensuring 
						wildlife values are better incorporated into land use decision-making, as well as large-scale conservation projects.</p>

			<div class="panel panel-default">
				<div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" href="#q6">So this isn't just a way to make more land off-limits to development?</div>
				<div id="q6" class="panel-collapse collapse">
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>No. CHAT is based on biological data and not biased in favor for or against any particular forms of development. State wildlife 
						agencies serve several different "customers" – from other government agencies, to outdoors enthusiasts, to conservation advocates and 
						business and industry groups. CHAT is a way for state agencies to provide all of their constituencies with credible and consistent 
						scientific data for use in their own research and planning.</p>

				<div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" href="#q7">As a private landowner, will my property show up as a crucial habitat on one of these maps so 
				that the government can impose limits on what I can do with my own land?</div>
				<div id="q7" class="panel-collapse collapse">
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>No. The Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies CHAT is a non-regulatory tool intended to guide planning of large-scale projects and 
						does not impose designations or identify species at the individual landowner scale. CHATs solely provide coarse–scale state wildlife agency information 
						to the public in an easy to access fashion. While private land could be shown as crucial habitat in a CHAT, that mapping result has no regulatory or legal 
						ramification. If a private landowner is concerned about how their land is depicted on a CHAT, they should meet with their state wildlife agency representative.</p>

				<div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" href="#q8">Does the CHAT cover near-shore or marine habitats?</div>
				<div id="q8" class="panel-collapse collapse">
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>The CHAT is a land-use planning tool not intended to map marine and near-shore habitats. However, species and habitats that cross the land-sea interface may, 
						however, be included in states’ crucial habitat maps. Some states on the West Coast included data on estuaries and coastal wetlands in CHAT, while 
						other states are still developing this information. Freshwater habitat for anadromous salmonids may be included in the Aquatic Species of Concern 
						dataset, and some marine mammals may be included based on their conservation status.</p>

				<div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" href="#q9">What mapping scale is used in WAFWA CHAT?</div>
				<div id="q9" class="panel-collapse collapse">
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>Most states map crucial habitat in hexagons with a resolution of one-square-mile. This provides a coarse level of resolution and is consistent with 
						several states' existing online planning tools. The states of California, Idaho and Wyoming chose to use a coarser resolution of three-square-mile 
						hexagons. Alaska uses a 10-square mile hexagon given its vast area.</p>

				<div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" href="#q10">How well does the crucial habitat data match up across state boundaries in the WAWFA CHAT?</div>
				<div id="q10" class="panel-collapse collapse">
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>The crucial habitat map reflects each state's habitat priorities. State boundaries are still apparent in many places on the Western Association of 
						Fish and Wildlife Agencies CHAT crucial habitat map for several reasons. In some cases, different data layers were used, or data layers were ranked 
						differently in the crucial habitat "roll-up" undertaken by each state. State laws and policies, as well as a states' organizational structure for data 
						management, may impact a states' crucial habitat map. Although a seamless regional map was not a goal, this information helps western state wildlife 
						agencies to recognize different habitat priorities from their neighbors and gives a common starting point to discuss those differences.</p>
